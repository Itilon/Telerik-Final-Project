    'Our creed, or guiding principle, is a quote by Baron de Coubertin: "The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."',
    'According to our philosophy, the good sportsmanship, sense of fair play, and respect for fellow athletes that is developed through participation in sports teaches men and women of different races, religions, and nationalities to work peacefully together in competition toward common goals. We work to expand such lessons beyond the sports arena in the hope of promoting peace and a sense of brotherhood throughout the world.']
